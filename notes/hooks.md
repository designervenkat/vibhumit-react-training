#### React Hooks

##### Introductions

-  React Hooks were introduced in version 16.8, providing a new approach to managing state and side effects within functional components.

-  Before version 16.8, React developers could only manage state and other features using class components.

-  They eliminate the need for class components in many cases, simplifying code structure and promoting a better code organisation.

##### What are hooks ?

-  Hooks are special functions that allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and other React features without writing class components.

-  They provide a more flexible and straightforward way to manage component logic and other advantages.

-  Each hook serves a specific purpose and specific to one task/functions.

-  We can use built-in Hooks or combine them to create our own custom Hooks.

##### Key advantages

-  Simplified Syntax: Hooks offer cleaner and more concise code compared to class components.

-  Reusability: Hooks enable the creation of custom reusable logic, enhancing modularity.

-  Improved Readability: Co-locating logic with components improves code readability and reduces cognitive load.

-  No this Keyword: Hooks eliminate the need for this, reducing confusion and potential bugs.

-  Better Performance Optimisation: Hooks enable React to optimise functional components more effectively.

-  Easier Testing: Functional components with Hooks are easier to test compared to class components.
